# enter-ontology

This is the ontology for the 'catalogue of digital applications and objects for museum education and research' of museum4punkt0. 

The ontology describes and represents digital applications and digital objects 
that were created during the project museum4punkt0. The described applications 
are used for purpose of museum education and are also subject to museum research efforts. 
Central aspects of the ontology are the use of (digital) tools and methods to create and research 
the applications and their effect on the user. It also contextualises digital representations of 
museum objects used in the applications.
This ontology may also be of interest to other cultural (heritage) institutions 
which use digital applications for the education of their audience.

##Project
This ontology is part of the project museum4punkt0 -
Digital Strategies for the Museum of the Future, sub-project "Zentrale wissenschaftliche Projektsteuerung".
